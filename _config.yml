  안녕하세요, 업무 자동화 및 백엔드 개발에 관심이 많은 신입 개발자입니다.
  Python과 Shell Script, Bash Shell을 활용하여 자동화 툴을 개발한 경험이 있으며, 테스트 자동화 및 성능 검증 프로세스를 최적화하는 작업을 수행했습니다. 반복적인 작업을 효율적으로 처리하는 솔루션을 구현하며, 개발 및 운영 환경의 생산성을 높이는 데 집중해왔습니다.

  또한, 웹 백엔드 개발을 배우며 Django를 활용한 프로젝트를 진행한 경험이 있습니다. 백엔드 로직을 설계하고 데이터베이스와 연동하는 과정에서 웹 애플리케이션의 구조를 이해하고, 유지보수성을 고려한 개발 방법을 익혔습니다.

  자동화 및 백엔드 개발 역량을 바탕으로 다양한 시스템 환경에서 최적의 성능을 내는 솔루션을 개발하는 것이 목표입니다. 새로운 기술을 배우고 적용하는 것을 즐기며, 보다 안정적이고 효율적인 개발을 위해 꾸준히 성장해 나가겠습니다.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
